Page Fault – A page fault happens when a running program accesses a memory page that is
mapped into the virtual address space, but not loaded in physical memory.
First In First Out (FIFO) –
This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps
track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When
a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.
Example -1. Consider page reference string 1, 3, 0, 3-, 5-, 6- and 3-page slots.
Initially all slots are empty, so when 1, 3, 0 came they are allocated to the empty slots —> 3
Page Faults.
when 3 comes, it is already in memory so—>0 Page Faults. Then 5 comes, it is not available
in memory so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e., 1—>1 Page Fault. Finally, 6 comes, it is also
not available in memory so it replaces the oldest page slot i.e., 3 — >1 Page Fault.
So total page faults = 5.
Empty 1 3 0 3 5 6
      1 1 1 5 5
        3 3 3 6
            0 0 0
Fault Fault Fault No fault Fault Fault
Total page fault5=5
Least Recently Used (LRU)– In this algorithm page will be replaced which is least recently
used. Let say the page reference string 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2. Initially we have 4-page slots
empty. Initially all slots are empty, so when 7 0 1 2 are allocated to the empty slots→ 4 Page
faults 0 is already there so→ 0 Page fault.
when 3 came it will take the place of 7 because it is least recently used —>1 Page fault 0 is
already in memory so —> 0 Page fault. 4 will takes place of 1 —> 1 Page Fault
Now for the further page reference string→ 0 Page fault because they are already available in the memory
Empty 7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2
      7 7 7 7 3 3
        0 0 0 0 0
          1 1 1 4
            2 2 2
